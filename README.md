# bike-sharing-NN
This program uses MLP Neural Network to predict the number of bikes needed each day for a bike-sharing business. The Neural network is constructed using the numpy libary using numpy arrays and matrix operations. It has a single hidden layer with 40 hidden nodes. The output layer has a single linear regression node, so there is no activation function. This network is complete with backpropogation as neither the tensorflow nor keras libraries are being used. The data used to train,validate, and test this network is the number of bike-riders every hour of every day for a two year period (1/1/11 - 12/31/12), which is stored in the file "/bike-sharing-data/hour.csv". The last 21 days worth of day was used for testing, the previous 60 days worth was used for validation, and everything before that was used for training. The network architecture is store in the file "my_answers.py" while the data manipulation,training, and testing are done in the jupyter notebook file "first_neural_network.ipynb". I also included the file "main.py" which includes all only the code necessary (no test scripts/data validation) to run this program in an easier to execute file.
